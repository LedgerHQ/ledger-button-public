# Import Rules for Ledger Button Project

## Import Guidelines
- Always use relative imports instead of absolute imports that start with `src/`
- When auto-importing, prefer relative paths like `./Component` or `../utils/helper` over `src/components/Component`
- Never use imports that start with `src/` - this is enforced by ESLint and should be avoided in auto-imports
- Use the shortest relative path possible (e.g., `./Button` instead of `../components/Button` when in the same directory)

## Code Style
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration for import sorting
- Maintain consistency with the project's TypeScript and React patterns
- Use the established component structure and naming conventions

## File Organization
- Keep components in their appropriate directories within the `src/` structure
- Use index files for clean exports
- Follow the existing domain-driven structure for business logic
